Twincat ADS Communication using CGO and Beckhoffs native TcAdsDLL
This is my first attempt at using CGO and Mingw64. Basically most ADS Libraries won't let you commnunicate to the localhost
so I decided to use the native libraries instead. Much inspiration and some code taken from https://github.com/stamp/goADS
